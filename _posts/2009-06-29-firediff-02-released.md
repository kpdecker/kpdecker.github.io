After 3 months of development the latest release of Firediff is ready for distribution.

The release includes

- Snapshots: Display the changes made to the DOM or CSS at any point in time
- Support for the new Firebug Insert/Remove CSS rule functionality
- Various bug fixes from the 0.1 release

The updated extension may be found [here](http://www.incaseofstairs.com/download/firediff/firediff0.2.xpi) as well as through Firefox's auto-update mechanism (for those currently running Firediff 0.1a2)

As always any issues may be reported on the [Firebug issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/list).
