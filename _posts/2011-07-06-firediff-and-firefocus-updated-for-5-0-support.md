<p>
Both Firediff and Firefocus have been updated to increase the target application support up to Firefox 5.0.</p>
<p>
Both of these are available from the update stream on this site. New installations are recommended to use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firediff/">Firediff</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefocus/">Firefocus</a> projects on AMO as these will be more responsive to the march of Firefox releases.</p>
