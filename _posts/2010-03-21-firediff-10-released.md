After more than a year of development I am absolutely ecstatic to announce the 1.0 release of Firediff. There were quite a few hiccups due to personal commitments in this development cycle, but I feel like this release is quite solid and brings quite a few must have features.

As noted in the previous alpha and beta announcements, this release adds many key features to the 0.2.1 release:

- Revert Changes
- Save Snapshot
- Save Diff
- Document Formatters
- Search
- Activation Data Handling Improvements
- Style attribute change handling

At this point I have achieved the majority of my initial goals for Firediff and feel as though it fits most of the realistic needs that I originally envisioned when I set out on this project. From this point onward the community is even more vital in defining the future direction of Firediff as I am looking for additional features that can be implemented.

The following features and fixes are currently under consideration for future releases but we are looking for more to implement.

- Filtering of the changes view
- Stack trace
- Free Edit Diffing
- Entire tree diffs on insertion or removal
- Improved handling of inline stylesheets
- Iframe Support
- Parity changes with Firebug enhancements

Any input from the community in terms of feature request or code contributions that will help improve the quality of the project. If you have a cool feature that you would like to see implemented in Firediff, please feel free to file bugs or enhancement requests with the fbug project or contact me directly.

Version 1.0 is available on [here](http://www.incaseofstairs.com/download/firediff/firediff1.0.xpi) and has been seeded to [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13179) (Under review as of this writing).
