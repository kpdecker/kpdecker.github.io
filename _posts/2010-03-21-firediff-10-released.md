<p>
After more than a year of development I am absolutely ecstatic to announce the 1.0 release of Firediff. There were quite a few hiccups due to personal commitments in this development cycle, but I feel like this release is quite solid and brings quite a few must have features.</p>
<p>
As noted in the previous alpha and beta announcements, this release adds many key features to the 0.2.1 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revert Changes</li>
<li>Save Snapshot</li>
<li>Save Diff</li>
<li>Document Formatters</li>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Activation Data Handling Improvements</li>
<li>Style attribute change handling</li>
</ul>
<p>
At this point I have achieved the majority of my initial goals for Firediff and feel as though it fits most of the realistic needs that I originally envisioned when I set out on this project. From this point onward the community is even more vital in defining the future direction of Firediff as I am looking for additional features that can be implemented.</p>
<p>
The following features and fixes are currently under consideration for future releases but we are looking for more to implement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Filtering of the changes view</li>
<li>Stack trace</li>
<li>Free Edit Diffing</li>
<li>Entire tree diffs on insertion or removal</li>
<li>Improved handling of inline stylesheets</li>
<li>Iframe Support</li>
<li>Parity changes with Firebug enhancements</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any input from the community in terms of feature request or code contributions that will help improve the quality of the project. If you have a cool feature that you would like to see implemented in Firediff, please feel free to file bugs or enhancement requests with the fbug project or contact me directly.</p>
