Just in time for the impending Firefox 4.0 release, Firediff has been updated to version 1.1.2. This release contains compatibility changes for Firefox 4.0 and Firebug 1.7 as well as the ability to sort CSS properties alphabetically

As always, the latest version is available [here](http://incaseofstairs.com/download/firediff/?C=M) and is currently under review at [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firediff/).
