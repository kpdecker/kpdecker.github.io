Firediff has been updated to 1.1.1 on the incaseofstairs servers. This version is a minor bug release that fixes the Save Diff and Snapshot functionality.

Updated package is available <a href="http://www.incaseofstairs.com/download/firediff/firediff1.1.1.xpi">here</a> and is under review at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13179/">AMO</a>

Thanks to Borris and Joel for letting me know about this issue. Feel free to contact me with any other issues you may have found.
