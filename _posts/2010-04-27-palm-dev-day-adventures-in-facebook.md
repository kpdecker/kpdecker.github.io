Last Friday and Saturday Palm hosted their Dev Day event at their Sunnyvale campus, which I had the pleasure of presenting some of the techniques we learned while developing the [Facebook for webOS](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=4620273157) application.

This presentation covered everything from our best practices to debugging and development tools to the common libraries we developed for the application. I would recommend webOS developers take a look as the topics covered deal with many common app development concerns.

As part of this presentation we have open sourced a collection of the libraries and tools that are used in the Facebook app development.

- [Open Source Libraries](http://github.com/palm/webos-samples/tree/master/tipsAndTricks/)
- [palm-run](http://github.com/dalmaer/palm-run)
- [Multi-stage Inspector](http://github.com/kpdecker/stage-inspect)
- [i18nScanner](http://github.com/kpdecker/i18nScanner)


The slides from my presentation are available on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/kpdecker/adventures-in-facebook-lessons-learned-from-a-landmark-webos-app) and a video should be published in the near future. Additional presentations from the event have been made available under the [palmdev](http://www.slideshare.net/tag/palmdev) slideshare tag

On a personal note, I would like to say that it was awesome to meet some of the developers who are using webOS, particularly in the Apps Lab breakout section!

Stay tuned for in depth posts on the topics discussed in my presentation.
