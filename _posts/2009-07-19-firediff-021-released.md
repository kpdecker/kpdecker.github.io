<p>
Due an a conflict between one of the libraries used by Firediff and just about everything else, I have pushed the Firediff release schedule forward some and rolled a <a href="http://www.incaseofstairs.com/download/firediff/firediff0.2.1.xpi">0.2.1 release</a>.</p>
<p>
This release includes fixes for the extension conflict, a new text diffing algorithm that will hopefully give better results as well as provide the basis of the unified diff feature that is planned for 0.1, and a few minor bug fixes to the Snapshot UI.</p>
<p>
Thank you to all of those who notified me of this conflict.</p>
