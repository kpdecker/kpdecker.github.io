Many thanks to [Ajaxian](http://www.ajaxian.com) for the bump yesterday.

A few people have reported issues with downloading the extension due to MIME types. Rather than trying to force WordPress to handle non-media files, I have moved the release location [here](http://www.incaseofstairs.com/download/firediff/?M=A). Future releases will be available at this location as well.

A few other issues within the code have been identified that are targeted at the 0.1 codeline. These are currently being examined and a new 0.1 branch release will likely be created in the next few days.
