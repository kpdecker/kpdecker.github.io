<p>
Many thanks to <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com">Ajaxian</a> for the bump yesterday.</p>
<p>
A few people have reported issues with downloading the extension due to MIME types. Rather than trying to force WordPress to handle non-media files, I have moved the release location <a href="http://www.incaseofstairs.com/download/firediff/?M=A">here</a>. Future releases will be available at this location as well.</p>
<p>
A few other issues within the code have been identified that are targeted at the 0.1 codeline. These are currently being examined and a new 0.1 branch release will likely be created in the next few days.</p>
