I'm pleased to announce that the initial version of [Firediff](/firediff/) is now available.

Firediff is a Firebug extension whose goal is to provide additional insight into the changes that are being made to the components of the page. As a 0.1 release this is effectively a preview of the final goals of the project. Many of the end goals such as diff generation, undo/redo functionality, and change persistence are still in the infancy.

Firediff currently requires a recent build of Firebug, with a strict requirement of at least version 1.4.

Many thanks to [John J. Barton](http://www.johnjbarton.com/), [Jan Odvarko](http://www.softwareishard.com/) and the rest of the Firebug community for assistance and input on this project.
