<p>
I'm pleased to announce that the initial version of <a href="/firediff/">Firediff</a> is now available.</p>
<p>
Firediff is a Firebug extension whose goal is to provide additional insight into the changes that are being made to the components of the page. As a 0.1 release this is effectively a preview of the final goals of the project. Many of the end goals such as diff generation, undo/redo functionality, and change persistence are still in the infancy.</p>
<p>
Firediff currently requires a recent build of Firebug, with a strict requirement of at least version 1.4.</p>
<p>
Many thanks to <a href="http://www.johnjbarton.com/">John J. Barton</a>, <a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/">Jan Odvarko</a> and the rest of the Firebug community for assistance and input on this project.</p>
